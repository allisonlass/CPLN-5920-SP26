## Course Description

This course teaches advanced spatial analysis and introduces data
science and machine learning tools within the context of urban planning
and public policy. Unlike private-sector data science focused solely on
optimization, our approach emphasizes public goods, governance, and
equity. We'll cover topics including transportation, housing, public
health, and criminal justice, using both spatial tools and predictive
modeling to help guide resource allocation and policy design.

**Key Focus:** Understanding concepts deeply rather than just completing
code. We emphasize fairness, transparency, and understanding the
implications of our models.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the semester, students will be able to:

-   Build and evaluate predictive models for public policy questions
-   Critically assess model generalizability, effectiveness, and bias
-   Navigate the full data science workflow: wrangling, exploration,
    modeling, and communication
-   Integrate spatial and temporal variables into policy-oriented models
-   Communicate uncertainty, limitations, and equity impacts to
    decision-makers
-   Create professional data science portfolios using Quarto

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assessment Structure

| Component | Weight | Description |
|------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| **Weekly In-Class Quizzes** | 35% | Concept-focused assessments (10 quizzes, lowest score dropped) |
| **Lab Assignments (5 total)** | 20% | Implementation + feedback response graded on 3-point scale |
| **Midterm: House Prediction Competition** | 15% | Team-based modeling competition with lightning presentations |
| **Final Modeling Challenge** | 25% | Real-world policy problem requiring model selection and justification |
| **Participation** | 5% | Attendance and engagement|

### Lab Assignment Structure

**Philosophy:** Lab assignments assess coding implementation,
documentation, and professional response to feedback. Knowledge of
underlying concepts is evaluated through weekly quizzes. Ultimately, the
labs will form your final portfolio for this course so the amount of
effort you put into each assignment is for your own benefit.

**Lab Assignment Structure:**

Labs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are individual assignments. Lab 3 (House
Prediction) is completed in teams of 3-4 students.

**Assignment Sequence:**

1.  **Census Data Exploration** (Individual)
2.  **Neighborhood Indicators** (Individual)
3.  **House Price Prediction Competition** (Team-based) - *Serves as
    Midterm*
4.  **Predictive Policing** - Poisson Regression (Individual)
5.  **Bike Share Rebalancing** - Space-Time Modeling (Individual)

**Final Modeling Challenge:** Teams work on a real-world policy problem
and choose the most appropriate modeling approach from the semester
(linear regression, count models, logistic regression, or space-time
modeling). The challenge emphasizes problem framing, methodology
justification, and complete workflow implementation.

**GitHub-Based Feedback Response:** Each assignment (after the first)
must include a `feedback-response.md` file addressing: - How you
incorporated previous TA feedback - Specific improvements made to visual
clarity of figures, documentation, writeups - Challenges encountered and
solutions attempted - Questions or areas needing clarification


**Lab Grading Scale:**

-   **2 points:** Complete implementation + feedback incorporation +
    clear documentation.
-   **1 point:** Somewhat complete, poor feedback integration or unclear
    work
-   **0 points:** Not submitted, incomplete, or no evidence of engaging
    with feedback

**Weekly Quiz:** Each class period will begin with an in-person, written quiz
on material from the prior week or the prior lab assignment. There will
be a total of 10 quizzes, but I will drop the lowest one.

## Course Format

**Structure:** Each 3-hour session combines conceptual lectures with
hands-on labs

**Expectations:**

-   Bring charged laptops for live coding and group work
-   Revise past work based on TA feedback for portfolio improvement
-   Engage actively in discussions and collaborative problem-solving
-   Attend class!

**Technology:** All work will be completed in R using Quarto for
reproducible, professional documentation.

## Academic Integrity & AI Policy

### Core Principle

All written work must be in your own words and demonstrate your
understanding of concepts.


### AI Tool Guidelines

-   **Permitted:** Using AI for debugging code, understanding error
    messages, understanding or decoding samples.
-   **Not Permitted:** Copying/pasting AI-generated text for
    assignments, having AI complete entire problems. Using AI to
    interpret your results or do your data analysis. Providing responses
    suggested by AI that you do not fully understand.
-   **Quiz Preparation:** Use AI to help understand concepts, but ensure
    you can explain ideas without assistance

[*Please see the university policy on academic
integrity*](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity/).
Cases of academic dishonesty on assignments will result in a score of 0
on the assignment and may incur disciplinary action.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Additional FAQ Information

**Late Assignments**: Please turn in your assignments on time. I understand 
that you have many other courses and I've done by best to make the required 
work reasonable. The concepts in this course are cumulative and it is necessary
to keep up with the work by turning in your assignments on time.

**Revising & Resubmitting Assignments**: The lab assignments cannot be revised
and resubmitted. You'll receive general feedback
on how to improve in future work and as long as you complete the
assignment and continue to improve, you'll 'pass' the assignment.
Therefore, there is no option to revise and resubmit for a higher grade.

**Email Policy:** 24-hour response time goal. For coding issues, please share
your repository link.
